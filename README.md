# ConsolePatchAutoInstaller
Scripts for automatically installing console patches.

## Important Information
In the index files, `GameRootDir` must be changed to the path of the base GamePipe folder.


You'll need to use nodemon to watch the GamePipe folder for changes.\
The terminal command to use is: `nodemon --watch <Path to GamePipe>`

The two scripts for console patch deployment are called `index_spawn_xbox.js` and `index_spawn_switch.js`
